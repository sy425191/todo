# todo
A jQuery powered task-manager website to Increase your work efficiency by adding, marking, deleting task. This task-manager is smart enough to remember your task for 72 years. 

## Problem solved
Human brain is like stack, and when a stack become full,, it kills background activity not knowing its importance. Managing task on a task manager makes this to easy. So a problem of forgeting task is solved   

## Challenges
Most of the task managers avilable on internet are paid and those which are free to use 'collect and sale your data'. The biggest chalenge is to minimize the operation cost of this task manager and provide users a true free and a true safe application. This challenge was solved by using cookies.


## Technique used
Rather than storing data in databases and I used cookies to store data in users broweser. EveryTime user creates a task then it will be stored as cookie and will be used to serve data when user comes back. I know this may look wierd that this website is using more than 50 cookies.. well the man is too lazy to check cookies if he have 50 tasks pending ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚

## Further improvements

Features to be added
